// In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called Main.java, 
// and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:
public class syntax { //The class name should always start with an uppercase. ex: class Main.
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

/* The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
Text must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".
System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);

There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output

System.out.print("Hello World! ");
System.out.print("I will print on the same line.");

// This will print text without moving to a new line
System.out.print("Welcome to Java! ");
System.out.print("Let's learn together.");

// This will print text and move to a new line
System.out.println();
System.out.println("This is a new line after print statements.");

// Another println example
System.out.println("Java is fun!");
